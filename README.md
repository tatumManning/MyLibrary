# MyLibrary
Mobile application for users to search books and create a database of their personal library. Users will be able to search for books and read reviews for each. They can add these books to their Library.

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:**
Swift, Xcode, MVC architectural pattern, NYTBS API, Google Books API, Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database

I am building this app with the MVC framework in mind. Users will sign in with their email and password saved through Firebase Authentication. All users' information is stored in Firestore. Users may edit and delete their entries. The search function and book information is all provided via the Google Books API and the New York Times Best Sellers API. Users will be ablt to add their own thoughts and reviews to each listing in their Library. They may search the catalolgue or their own Library by title, author, or genre. 

## What's Next:
This project is ongoing, I will update this file as I continue to build the application. Users will be able to create a wishlist for all the books they have not yet read. Eventually I would like there to be an Explore option in which books are recommended based on the user's library and preferences. I would also like to add a barcode scanning feature that allows users to scan the barcode on their books and have them automatically placed in their database without having to search for them manually.
